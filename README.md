# About the project
Our team aims to develop games that are both entertaining and helping players practice their logical thinking. After the whole group researched and brought up our ideas, we reached the conclusion of the same thing that we will do about the game ”Đuổi hình bắt chữ". Because according to research, the current ”Đuổi hình bắt chữ" is quite interested by many players, not only because of its entertainment but also benefits in the development of players' thinking. Besides, we will split into 2 versions. 1 is the Vietnamese version, 2 is the english version.
